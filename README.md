<h4>A website with features similar to OLX</h4>

I started just with frontend, so for to test Login and other things i'm using an API from B7WEB that retuns the token like we use for to identify that the user is logged.
For to connect your own API built with Node.js, PHP whatever, you just need to change the file OlxAPI.js.

The email and password that works for test in the API:<br/>
